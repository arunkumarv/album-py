# Why

Because apple iPhotos are horrible

## ToDo

1. A renaming program that will hierarchically rename the files in a folder keeping the extension as such
2. Find duplicates
	- To do that first create the hash of all the files (hash to filename map should be there in another file)
	- Store it in a file and then `sort <file> | uniq -c`
	- Delete the duplicates
3. The AI stuff for grouping - will thing of it later
