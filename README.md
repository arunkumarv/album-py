# What and Why

This repo has programs to

- move-duplicates: Because I am tired with duplicates. Can be used for any files
- doc-search: I have some photos which are basically bills. I would like to make a data out of it to search.

## How to

### move duplicates

`python main.py -i <source folder> -o <destination folder>`\
`eg: main.py /Users/akv/MyPictures -o /Users/akv/Duplicates` - this command if fails check the main.py python path.

### doc search
